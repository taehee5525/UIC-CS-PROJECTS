I picked 13 songs I liked when I was younger. These songs might be too old for me to know, but it is because I was living in Korea until 2008. Before I came to the United States, I did not speak English at all. Therefore, I did not have much interest in American songs. However, these songs were different. They were very famous in Korea. Probably everyone in my age knows these songs. That is how much these songs were loved and known. 
I loved the melodies of the songs, even though I did not understand English at all, I loved these songs. I tried to translate some of the songs because I wanted to fully understand the song, so that I could fully enjoy the song.
My most favorite song from this list is My Love of Westlife. I was only twelve years old when I first listened to this song. I was mesmerized by the beauty of this melody. I was trying to understand the song by using the dictionary. It took hours for me to translate each word into Korean. However, I did not feel tired. After revealing the meanings of the lyrics, I was even more mesmerized by the song because it was much more beautiful and heart-warming than I expected.
